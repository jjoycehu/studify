## Have you ever wished that you had the perfect playlist to study with but Spotify just wasn't getting the vibes right?
You can take a study-personality test to find the perfect playlist using Studify!

I used the Spotify api to collect a dataset of 800 user-created playlists, so the music used is more representative of students' actual taste in study music in comparison to Spotify's
generated playlists that often contains promotional or featured music.
